# FibonacciNumber

## Description
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).

## Examples
* Example1
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

* Example2
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

* Example3
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

Note:
0<= N >=30.

## Similar Problem - Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

* Example1
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

* Example2
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
